# Review: Aaliyah - Ultimate Aaliyah (2CD) (2005)
 
Aaliyah was one of the most talented and influential R&B singers of her generation, who left behind a legacy of timeless hits and a loyal fanbase. Her tragic death in 2001 cut short her promising career, but her music lives on through various compilations and tributes. One of them is *Ultimate Aaliyah*, a 2CD + DVD set that was released in 2005 in the UK, Australia, and Japan.
 
The first CD contains 16 of her greatest hits, spanning from her debut album *Age Ain't Nothing But A Number* to her posthumous release *I Care 4 U*. The songs showcase her versatility as an artist, from the smooth ballads like "One In A Million" and "The One I Gave My Heart To" to the upbeat jams like "Try Again" and "Rock The Boat". The CD also features some of her collaborations with Timbaland, Missy Elliott, and DMX, who helped shape her distinctive sound and style.

The second CD consists of rare tracks that were previously released on soundtracks, albums by Timbaland & Magoo, or as hidden tracks. Some of the highlights include "Are You Feelin' Me", "Come Back In One Piece", and "I Am Music". The CD also includes a remix of "More Than A Woman" by Bump N Flex and a dedication song by Wyclef Jean called "Hold On". These tracks offer a glimpse into Aaliyah's diverse musical influences and potential.

The DVD features a 60-minute documentary titled *The Aaliyah Story*, which includes rare behind-the-scenes footage, promo video clips, and interviews with Aaliyah, Missy Elliott, P. Diddy, Damon Dash, and Timbaland. The DVD also has a photo gallery with images from her career and personal life. The documentary is a touching tribute to Aaliyah's life and legacy, as well as a fascinating insight into her creative process and personality.
 
*Ultimate Aaliyah* is a must-have for any fan of Aaliyah or R&B music in general. It is a comprehensive collection of her best songs, as well as some hidden gems that deserve more attention. It is also a great introduction to her music for those who are not familiar with her work. The DVD adds more value to the package, as it provides a visual and emotional complement to the audio CDs. *Ultimate Aaliyah* is a fitting tribute to one of the most beloved and missed artists of all time.
  
One of the reasons why *Ultimate Aaliyah* stands out among other compilations is that it includes some of her rare and unreleased songs that were not widely available before. For instance, "Don't Know What To Tell Ya" is a song that was recorded for her third album *Aaliyah*, but was left out of the final tracklist. It was later released as a single in Europe and Australia, but not in the US. The song is a catchy mid-tempo track with an Arabic-inspired beat and a confident vocal performance by Aaliyah.
 
Another rare song is "I Am Music", which features Aaliyah singing alongside Static of Playa and Timbaland. The song was originally intended for Timbaland's album *Indecent Proposal*, but was scrapped due to Aaliyah's death. It was later leaked online and included on *Ultimate Aaliyah*. The song is a funky and futuristic tribute to music as a universal language and a source of inspiration. Aaliyah sings with passion and charisma, proving her status as a musical icon.
 
The DVD also contains some exclusive footage that fans will appreciate. For example, it shows Aaliyah recording "More Than A Woman" in the studio with Timbaland, as well as performing the song live on Top of the Pops. It also shows her filming the video for "Rock The Boat" in the Bahamas, which was her last project before her fatal plane crash. The DVD also features some of her most memorable interviews, where she talks about her music, her influences, her goals, and her personal life.
 
*Ultimate Aaliyah* is a comprehensive and satisfying collection that honors Aaliyah's legacy and showcases her talent. It is a testament to her impact on the music industry and culture, as well as her enduring appeal to fans around the world. It is also a reminder of what could have been, if she had lived longer and fulfilled her potential. *Ultimate Aaliyah* is a must-have for any fan of Aaliyah or R&B music in general.
