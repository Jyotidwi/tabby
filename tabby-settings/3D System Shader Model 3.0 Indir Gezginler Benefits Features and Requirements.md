The solution is to download and install a software called SwiftShader, which is a software renderer that can emulate the features of 3D graphics hardware on your CPU. SwiftShader can run games that require DirectX 9.0 or OpenGL 2.0, such as Farming Simulator 17, with acceptable performance and quality.
 
Here are the steps to fix the 3D System Shader Model 3.0 error in Farming Simulator 17 using SwiftShader:
 
1. Download SwiftShader from this link: [https://dosyalarim.com/cepsortkore1970/3d-system-shader-model-30-indir-gezginler](https://dosyalarim.com/cepsortkore1970/3d-system-shader-model-30-indir-gezginler). This is a modified version of SwiftShader that works with Farming Simulator 17.
2. Extract the zip file and copy the d3d9.dll file to the folder where you installed Farming Simulator 17. For example, C:\Program Files (x86)\Farming Simulator 17.
3. Launch the game and enjoy playing without the 3D System Shader Model 3.0 error.

Note: This solution may not work for everyone, and it may cause some graphical glitches or performance issues. If you want to play Farming Simulator 17 with the best quality and performance, you should consider upgrading your graphics card to one that supports Shader Model 3.0 or higher.
