# How to Update Your Carminat TomTom Europe Maps for Free
 
If you have a Renault car with a Carminat TomTom navigation system, you might be wondering how to update your maps without paying for a subscription. Well, there is a way to do it for free, using a simple software and a compatible SD card. Here is how:
 
1. Download the latest Carminat TomTom Europe maps from this link: [https://mega.nz/file/WBpkAbab#McWnGyb4uy...q0H54gjRDo](https://mega.nz/file/WBpkAbab#McWnGyb4uy...q0H54gjRDo). The password is carminat2020. This file contains the maps for Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom and Vatican City[^1^].
2. Extract the file using Winrar or 7-zip. You will get a folder called SD with several files inside.
3. Copy the contents of the SD folder to an empty fat32 formatted SD card (8GB or more). You can use any SD card that is compatible with your Carminat TomTom device.
4. Open the ttgo.bif file with Notepad and edit your DeviceUniqueID. This is a 10-digit number that identifies your device. You can find it by inserting your original SD card into your computer and opening the ttgo.bif file there. Copy the DeviceUniqueID and paste it into the new ttgo.bif file. Save and close the file.
5. Start the TTActivator software that is included in the SD folder. Press ACTIVATE and wait for the confirmation message.
6. Eject the SD card from your computer and insert it into your Carminat TomTom device. Turn on your car and wait for the device to recognize the new maps.
7. Enjoy your updated navigation!
