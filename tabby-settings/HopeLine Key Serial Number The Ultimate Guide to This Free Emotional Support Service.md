## How Does HopeLine Work?
 
HopeLine works by connecting you with a Crisis Counselor who is trained to provide emotional support and crisis intervention. A Crisis Counselor is not a therapist, but a volunteer who cares about you and wants to help you. They will listen to you, empathize with you, and help you explore your options and coping strategies.
 
When you text HOPELINE to 741741, you will receive an automated message that asks you to share more about what's going on. You can reply with whatever you feel comfortable sharing. The Crisis Counselor will then introduce themselves and start the conversation. You can text back and forth with the Crisis Counselor as long as you need to. The conversation typically ends when you and the Crisis Counselor both feel comfortable deciding that you are calm and in a safe place.
 
The goal of HopeLine is to get you to a calm, safe place where you can make healthy decisions for yourself. Sometimes that means providing you with a referral to further help, such as a therapist, a hotline, or a local resource. Sometimes it just means being there and listening. The Crisis Counselor will not judge you, tell you what to do, or give you advice. They will respect your choices and support you in whatever way they can.
  
## Why Should You Use HopeLine?
 
HopeLine is a useful service for anyone who needs emotional support in any situation. You don't have to be suicidal or in a crisis to use HopeLine. You can text HopeLine about anything that is bothering you, such as stress, anxiety, depression, loneliness, grief, relationship issues, bullying, self-harm, abuse, or anything else. No problem is too big or too small for HopeLine.
 
HopeLine is also convenient and accessible. You can use HopeLine from anywhere, anytime, as long as you have a phone and a signal. You don't have to make an appointment, wait in line, or talk to someone face-to-face. You can text HopeLine at your own pace and comfort level. You can also end the conversation whenever you want.
 
HopeLine is also free and confidential. You don't have to pay anything to use HopeLine. You don't have to provide any personal information or sign up for anything. You don't have to worry about anyone finding out about your conversation or reading your messages. Your privacy and safety are important to HopeLine.
