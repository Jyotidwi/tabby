# How to Find and Activate Windows 10 Home N Serial Key
 
Windows 10 Home N is a specific edition of Windows 10 that is designed for customers in Europe. It has the same features as Windows 10 Home, except that it does not include certain media-related technologies like Windows Media Player, Groove Music, Movies & TV, Voice Recorder, and Skype. If you have a device that came with Windows 10 Home N preinstalled, or if you want to upgrade to this edition from another version of Windows, you will need a valid serial key to activate it.
 
A serial key, also known as a product key, is a 25-character code that verifies that your copy of Windows is genuine and not used on more devices than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. Without a serial key, you won't be able to activate Windows 10 Home N and enjoy its full benefits.

There are different ways to find and activate your Windows 10 Home N serial key, depending on how you got your copy of Windows. In this article, we will explain some of the most common methods and provide you with some generic keys that you can use for evaluation or testing purposes.
  
## Method 1: Check your device packaging or confirmation email
 
If you bought a new device that came with Windows 10 Home N preinstalled, you should find your serial key on a label or a card inside the box. If you bought Windows 10 Home N as a digital download from Microsoft or an authorized retailer, you should receive a confirmation email with your serial key. Make sure to keep your serial key in a safe place, as you might need it in the future if you need to reinstall or reactivate Windows.

## Method 2: Use a generic key
 
If you don't have a serial key, or if you want to install or upgrade to Windows 10 Home N for evaluation or testing on a PC or virtual machine, you can use a generic key. A generic key is a default key that allows you to install a specific edition of Windows, but does not activate it. Using a generic key can be helpful if you want to try out Windows 10 Home N before buying it, or if you don't have your genuine product key currently available and you will activate later when able.
 
Here is the list of generic keys for Windows 10 Home N:
 
- Windows 10 Home N: 3KHY7-WNT83-DGQKR-F7HPR-844BM [^2^]
- Windows 10 Home N (Retail): 4CPRK-NM3K3-X6XXQ-RXX86-WXCHW [^1^]

To use a generic key, follow these steps:

1. During installation, enter the generic key when prompted, or skip this step and enter it later.
2. After installation, go to Settings > System > Activation > Update product key > Change product key.
3. Enter the generic key and click Next.
4. You should see a message saying that Windows is installed but not activated.
5. You can now use Windows 10 Home N for up to 30 days without activation. After that period, you will see a watermark on the lower right corner of the screen reminding you to activate Windows. You will also lose some personalization features like changing the wallpaper.
6. To activate Windows 10 Home N with a genuine product key, repeat steps 2-4 and enter your valid serial key instead of the generic one.

## Method 3: Use an activation tool
 
If none of the above methods work for you, or if you don't want to buy a serial key from Microsoft or an authorized retailer, you can try using an activation tool. An activation tool is a software program that bypasses the activation process and makes Windows think that it is activated. There are many activation tools available online, but some of them may contain viruses or malware that can harm your device or steal your personal information. Therefore, we do not recommend using this method unless you know what you are doing and trust the source of the tool.
 
To use an activation tool, follow these steps:

1. Download an activation tool from a reputable website. Make sure to 8cf37b1e13
