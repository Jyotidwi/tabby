### What is decompression?
 
Decompression is the process of extracting compressed data from a file or a folder. Compression is a technique that reduces the size of data by removing redundant or unnecessary information. Compression is useful for saving disk space and bandwidth, as well as speeding up the transfer of data. However, compression also requires decompression to restore the original data before it can be used or executed. Decompression usually happens automatically when you open or run a compressed file or folder.
 
### What causes decompression errors?
 
Decompression errors are errors that occur when the decompression process fails or encounters a problem. Decompression errors can have various causes, such as:

- Corrupted or incomplete compressed files or folders.
- Incompatible or outdated software or hardware.
- Insufficient disk space or memory.
- Malware or virus infection.
- Interference from other programs or processes.

Decompression errors can prevent you from accessing or using the compressed data, and may also cause other problems such as crashes, freezes, or performance issues.
