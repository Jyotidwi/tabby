## Price Action Patterns: What Are They and How to Trade Them
 
Price action patterns are formations that appear on the price chart and indicate the likely future direction of the price. They are based on the principle that history tends to repeat itself, and that the market tends to move in cycles of trends and corrections.
 
There are many types of price action patterns, but some of the most common and reliable ones are:

- Pin bars: These are candles with a long tail and a small body, indicating a rejection of a certain price level. They can signal a reversal or a continuation of the trend, depending on the context.
- Engulfing bars: These are candles that completely cover the previous candle, indicating a strong change in momentum. They can signal a reversal or a continuation of the trend, depending on the context.
- Inside bars: These are candles that are completely contained within the range of the previous candle, indicating a consolidation or a pause in the market. They can signal a breakout or a continuation of the trend, depending on the context.

To trade these patterns, you need to consider the following factors:

- The location of the pattern: The pattern should appear near a significant support or resistance level, such as a trendline, a moving average, a Fibonacci retracement, or a horizontal line.
- The direction of the trend: The pattern should be in alignment with the overall trend direction, as determined by higher timeframes or indicators.
- The confirmation of the pattern: The pattern should be confirmed by a subsequent candle that closes in the direction of the pattern, or by other signals such as volume, divergence, or oscillators.

By using these criteria, you can filter out false signals and increase your chances of success. You can also use MM4X Price Action Software to help you identify and trade these patterns with ease and accuracy.
