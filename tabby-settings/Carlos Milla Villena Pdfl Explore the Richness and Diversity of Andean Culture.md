Carlos Milla Villena is a visionary and a pioneer who has opened new horizons for understanding the Andean culture and its contribution to humanity. His books are essential reading for anyone who wants to discover the hidden treasures of the Andes and their relevance for today's world.
  
One of the most influential books by Carlos Milla Villena is *GÃ©nesis de la Cultura Andina*, which was first published in 1983 and has been reprinted several times. In this book, he presents his theory of the "Andean genesis", which states that the Andean culture originated from a primordial civilization that emerged in the highlands of Peru and Bolivia around 15,000 years ago.
 
He supports his theory with archaeological, linguistic, genetic, astronomical, and mythological evidence, and shows how the Andean culture developed a complex social organization, a sophisticated calendar system, a rich artistic expression, and a profound spiritual knowledge. He also traces the historical evolution of the Andean culture, from its origins to its decline after the Spanish conquest.
 
Another important book by Carlos Milla Villena is *Los Reinos Perdidos de los Andes*, which was published in 1998 and has been translated into several languages. In this book, he explores the connections between the Andean culture and other ancient civilizations around the world. He claims that the Andean culture was part of a global network of cultural exchange and diffusion, and that it influenced and was influenced by cultures such as Egypt, India, China, Mesopotamia, and Atlantis.
 
He bases his claims on comparative studies of mythology, symbolism, architecture, art, religion, science, and technology. He also proposes that the Andean culture had contact with extraterrestrial beings who taught them advanced knowledge and skills. He suggests that some of the ancient monuments and artifacts found in the Andes are evidence of this contact.
