## How to Set Up the Lighting and Materials for Your Scene
 
V-Ray for Revit 2016 integrates seamlessly with Revit's native lighting and materials system. This means that you can use any Revit light or material in your scene and V-Ray will render it accurately. However, if you want to achieve more realistic results, you can also use V-Ray's own lighting and material tools.
 
V-Ray for Revit 2016 offers several types of lights that you can use to illuminate your scene. These include:

- V-Ray Sun and Sky: A physically based sun and sky model that simulates the natural daylight conditions.
- V-Ray Dome Light: A spherical light source that emits light from an HDR image or a color.
- V-Ray IES Light: A light source that uses an IES file to define its shape and intensity.
- V-Ray Spot Light: A directional light source that emits a cone-shaped beam of light.
- V-Ray Rectangle Light: A rectangular light source that emits light from one or both sides.
- V-Ray Sphere Light: A spherical light source that emits light from its surface.
- V-Ray Mesh Light: A light source that emits light from any geometry object.

To add a V-Ray light to your scene, you can use the V-Ray toolbar or the V-Ray Lights tab in the Revit Properties panel. You can adjust the parameters of each light in the V-Ray Asset Editor or in the Revit Properties panel. You can also use the V-Ray Light Lister to manage all the lights in your scene.
 
V-Ray for Revit 2016 also supports Revit's native materials and allows you to edit them in the V-Ray Asset Editor. You can assign different types of V-Ray materials to your objects, such as:

## How to Use the Interactive Viewport and the V-Ray Frame Buffer
 
V-Ray for Revit 2016 provides two ways to preview and render your scene: the interactive viewport and the V-Ray Frame Buffer. The interactive viewport is a fast and responsive preview window that shows you how your scene will look like in real time. You can use it to adjust your lighting, materials, camera, and other settings without waiting for a full render. The interactive viewport is enabled by default when you open Revit 2016. You can toggle it on and off by clicking on the Interactive button on the V-Ray toolbar.
 
The V-Ray Frame Buffer is a separate window that shows you the final render of your scene. You can use it to fine-tune your render settings, apply post-processing effects, save and compare render images, and export your renders to various formats. The V-Ray Frame Buffer is opened when you click on the Render button on the V-Ray toolbar. You can also access it from the V-Ray menu or by pressing F10 on your keyboard.
