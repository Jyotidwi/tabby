## Step 1: Purchase the Scenery
 
The first thing you need to do is to purchase the scenery from simMarket. You can find it here[^1^]. The price is 11.79 â¬ (or 7.66 $ USD with a 35% discount until April 27th). Once you complete the payment, you will receive an email with a download link and a serial number.
 
## Step 2: Download the Scenery
 
The next step is to download the scenery from the link provided in the email. The file size is about 300 MB, so it might take some time depending on your internet speed. Once the download is finished, you will have a ZIP file named "FSX\_P3D\_KBDL\_Bradley\_International\_Airport\_by\_FSXCENERY.zip".
 
## Step 3: Extract the Scenery
 
The third step is to extract the scenery from the ZIP file. You can use any software that can handle ZIP files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. To extract the scenery, right-click on the ZIP file and select "Extract Here" or "Extract to FSX\_P3D\_KBDL\_Bradley\_International\_Airport\_by\_FSXCENERY". You will get a folder with the same name as the ZIP file.
 
## Step 4: Install the Scenery
 
The final step is to install the scenery in your flight simulator. To do this, you need to copy the folder "FSX\_P3D\_KBDL\_Bradley\_International\_Airport\_by\_FSXCENERY" to your main FSX or P3D folder. For example, if your FSX folder is located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X", then you need to copy the folder there.
 
After copying the folder, you need to activate the scenery in your flight simulator. To do this, launch FSX or P3D and go to "Settings" > "Scenery Library". Click on "Add Area" and browse to the folder "FSX\_P3D\_KBDL\_Bradley\_International\_Airport\_by\_FSXCENERY". Select it and click on "OK". The scenery will be added to your library and you can move it up or down in the priority list if you want.
