Microsoft Visio Professional 2007 is a diagramming software that allows you to create and share professional-looking diagrams for various purposes, such as business processes, network diagrams, flowcharts, organizational charts, and more. If you have a valid product key for Visio Professional 2007, but you don't have the installation disc, you may be wondering how to download the ISO file of the software.
 
Unfortunately, Microsoft no longer provides direct downloads for older Office products, including Visio 2007. If you try to enter your product key on the Microsoft Software Recovery website, you will get a message saying that "To download Office 2010 or 2013, visit this website". However, there are still some ways to get the ISO file of Visio Professional 2007 legally and safely.

One option is to contact Microsoft Support and request a replacement disc. You will need to provide proof of purchase and your product key. Depending on your region and availability, you may have to pay a shipping fee or wait for several weeks for the disc to arrive.
 
Another option is to download the ISO file from a third-party website that hosts archived copies of Microsoft software. One such website is Archive.org, which has a page for Office Visio Professional 2007[^1^]. You can download the ISO file from there and use your product key to activate it. However, you should be careful and virus check the download before installing it on your computer. You should also do it on a standalone computer if possible, as some websites may contain malware or unwanted programs.
 
A third option is to upgrade to a newer version of Visio, such as Visio Plan 2, which is the latest and most powerful diagramming suite from Microsoft. You can enjoy the latest features and get product support with Visio Plan 2. You can also access your diagrams from anywhere with the web and mobile apps. You can compare the plans and pricing of Visio on the Microsoft website[^3^].
 
Whichever option you choose, make sure you have a valid product key for Visio Professional 2007 before downloading or installing the software. If you don't have one, you may need to purchase a new license or subscribe to a Visio plan.
