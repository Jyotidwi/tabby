Some of the features that Reikan FoCal 51 offers are:

- Fully Auto Calibration: This feature allows you to tune your autofocus automatically with just one click. FoCal will take control of your camera, adjust the settings, take test shots and analyse the results. It will then apply the optimal AF adjustment value to your camera and lens.
- Calibration Check: This feature allows you to quickly verify the accuracy of your autofocus without performing a full calibration. FoCal will take a few test shots and compare them with the expected results based on your previous calibration data.
- MultiTest: This feature allows you to run multiple tests in one session, such as Autofocus Consistency, Aperture Sharpness and Dust Analysis. You can choose which tests to run and in what order, and FoCal will generate a comprehensive report for each test.
- Stabilisation Test: This feature allows you to measure the effectiveness of your lens or camera stabilisation system. FoCal will take test shots at different shutter speeds and analyse the sharpness of each image. It will then calculate the amount of blur reduction that your stabilisation system provides.
- Target Optimisation: This feature allows you to optimise the FoCal target for your specific camera and lens combination. FoCal will measure the contrast and resolution of the target and suggest the best size and distance for optimal results.
