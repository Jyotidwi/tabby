If you are a fan of mystery, crime, and suspense, you might want to check out Still Life 2, a point-and-click adventure game developed by Microids and released in 2009. Still Life 2 is the sequel to Still Life, which was released in 2005. Both games follow the investigations of FBI agent Victoria McPherson, who is tracking down a serial killer known as the East Coast Killer.
 
In Still Life 2, Victoria is sent to Maine, where the body of a journalist named Ellen Dunnigan has been found. She soon discovers that Ellen was working on a story about the East Coast Killer, and that she might have been his latest victim. Victoria teams up with journalist Paloma Hernandez, who is also interested in the case. Together, they try to find clues and solve puzzles that will lead them to the killer's identity and location.

Still, if you are looking for a challenging and engaging point-and-click adventure game with a dark and twisted plot, you might want to give Still Life 2 a try.
  
Still Life 2 is not a game for the faint of heart. It contains graphic scenes of torture, murder, and mutilation that might shock or disturb some players.

Some of the puzzles also have time limits, which add to the tension and urgency of the situation.
 
However, Still Life 2 also has some flaws that might affect your enjoyment of the game. The game has some technical issues, such as bugs, glitches, crashes, and poor optimization. The game also has some outdated graphics and animations that might look dated by today's standards. The game also has some voice acting and dialogue that might sound cheesy or unnatural at times.

Still Life 2 is a game that will appeal to fans of the genre who are looking for a mature and complex story with a lot of twists and turns. The game will also appeal to fans of the previous games in the series who want to see how the story ends. However, the game might not appeal to casual gamers who are looking for a more accessible and polished experience. The game might also not appeal to players who are sensitive to violence or gore. Still Life 2 is a game that has its strengths and weaknesses, but it is definitely a game that will leave an impression on you.
