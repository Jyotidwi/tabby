# CYME.CYMCAP.v4.5.R2.zip: A Software for Power Cable Ampacity Rating
 
CYME.CYMCAP.v4.5.R2.zip is a compressed file that contains the installation files for the CYMCAP software, which is a tool for calculating the ampacity and temperature rise of power cable installations[^1^]. Ampacity is the maximum current that a power cable can carry without damaging its electrical properties[^1^]. The CYMCAP software is designed to help engineers design and upgrade power cable installations with confidence and accuracy, as well as to increase system reliability and efficiency[^1^]. The software can handle various types of cable installations, such as duct banks, tunnels, troughs, casings, circuit crossings, and more[^1^]. It can also perform various types of analyses, such as duct bank optimizer, magnetic fields, cable impedance, short circuit ratings, and more[^1^]. The software is compatible with Windows operating systems and requires a license key to activate[^2^]. The CYMCAP software is developed by CYME International T&D Inc., a company that provides software solutions for transmission, distribution, and industrial power systems[^1^]. The CYMCAP software is part of the CYME suite of products that also includes CYMDIST, CYMTCC, CYMGRD, and more[^1^]. The latest version of the CYMCAP software is v9.0, which was released in June 2020[^1^]. The v4.5.R2 version is an older version that was released in 2013[^4^]. The CYME.CYMCAP.v4.5.R2.zip file can be downloaded from various online sources, such as uploaded.net[^2^], phyliciajlchou.wixsite.com[^4^], brakenetic.com[^5^], and sway.office.com[^3^]. However, some of these sources may not be reliable or safe, and may contain viruses or malware. Therefore, it is recommended to download the CYMCAP software from the official website of CYME International T&D Inc., which also provides technical support and updates for the software users[^1^].

The CYMCAP software is based on the IEC 60287 and IEEE 835 standards for calculating the ampacity and temperature rise of power cables. The software uses a finite element method to model the thermal behavior of the cable system and its surroundings. The software allows the user to define various parameters for the cable installation, such as cable type, conductor size, insulation material, laying method, soil thermal resistivity, ambient temperature, load profile, and more. The software then calculates the steady-state and transient ampacity and temperature rise of the cable system under various operating conditions. The software also provides graphical and tabular outputs of the results, as well as reports and diagrams that can be exported to other formats.
 
The CYMCAP software is a useful tool for power cable engineers who need to design and optimize cable installations for various applications, such as underground distribution networks, industrial plants, offshore platforms, submarine cables, and more. The software can help engineers to select the appropriate cable size and type, determine the optimal laying configuration, evaluate the thermal impact of different scenarios, assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of different options, and ensure the compliance with the relevant standards and regulations. The software can also help engineers to troubleshoot and solve problems that may arise in existing cable installations, such as overloading, overheating, aging, faults, and more.
 
The CYMCAP software is constantly updated and improved by CYME International T&D Inc., which has over 30 years of experience in developing software solutions for power systems. The company also offers training courses and webinars for the CYMCAP software users, as well as consulting services and custom solutions for specific needs. The company has a global network of customers and resellers in over 100 countries, and works closely with industry partners and research institutions to ensure the quality and reliability of its products. The company's mission is to provide innovative and practical software solutions that help power system engineers to design and operate safe, efficient, and reliable power systems.
