To automate Gross Beat in FL Studio, you can use automation clips or MIDI notes. Automation clips allow you to control the slot switching of time and volume sections independently. You can create automation clips by right-clicking on a slot and selecting "Create automation clip". You can then edit the automation clip in the playlist or in the piano roll.
 
MIDI notes allow you to control the slot switching of both time and volume sections simultaneously. You can assign MIDI notes to slots by right-clicking on a slot and selecting "Assign to MIDI note". You can then send MIDI notes to Gross Beat from a MIDI keyboard or a MIDI out plugin.
 
Gross Beat can be used with other plugins to create more complex and creative effects. You can use Gross Beat before or after other plugins in the mixer chain, depending on the desired result. For example, you can use Gross Beat before a reverb plugin to create a gated reverb effect. Or you can use Gross Beat after a distortion plugin to create a glitchy distortion effect.
